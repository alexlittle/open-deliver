      # Customizable error responses come in three flavors:
      # 1) plain text
      # 2) local redirects
      # 3) external redirects
      #
      # Some examples:
      #ErrorDocument 500 "The server made a boo boo."
      #ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
      #ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl"
      #ErrorDocument 402 http://www.example.com/subscription_info.html
      #

      #
      # Putting this all together, we can internationalize error responses.
      #
      # We use Alias to redirect any /error/HTTP_<error>.html.var response to
      # our collection of by-error message multi-language collections.  We use
      # includes to substitute the appropriate text.
      #
      # You can modify the messages' appearance without changing any of the
      # default HTTP_<error>.html.var files by adding the line:
      #
      #Alias /error/include/ "/your/include/path/"
      #
      # which allows you to create your own set of files by starting with the
      # /usr/share/apache2/error/include/ files and copying them to /your/include/path/,
      # even on a per-VirtualHost basis.  If you include the Alias in the global server
      # context, is has to come _before_ the 'Alias /error/ ...' line.
      #
      # The default include files will display your Apache version number and your
      # ServerAdmin email address regardless of the setting of ServerSignature.
      #
      # WARNING: The configuration below will NOT work out of the box if you have a
      #		  SetHandler directive in a <Location /> context somewhere. Adding
      #		  the following three lines AFTER the <Location /> context should
      #		  make it work in most cases:
      #		  <Location /error/>
      #			 SetHandler none
      #		  </Location>

              #	 This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.

              #   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
              #   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
              #   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
              #   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
              #   approach you can use one of the following variables:
              #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
              #	 This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
              #	 SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
              #	 the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
              #	 this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
              #	 mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
              #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
              #	 This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
              #	 SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
              #	 alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
              #	 practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
              #	 this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
              #	 works correctly.
              #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP

              #   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
              #   "force-response-1.0" for this.
